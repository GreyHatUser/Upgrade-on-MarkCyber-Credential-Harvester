# Credential-Exfiltration Payload
This is a greatly upgraded and enhanced version of the 'initially based on' Credential Harvester payload made by MarkCyber, it includes many security, failsafe and forsenic trace deletion that werent included on the first payload.
After the 2.0.0 it became purely my own work as the amount of upgrades greatly differ from the original source.
